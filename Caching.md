# Caching
  ## Aim of caching.
   * Increase efficiency
   * Reduce process time
   * Avoid load on database
   * Save network call
  ## Different types of caching techniques
   * #### Spatial Caching
     * Caching technique based on locality of data and the 
     * Imports data from the local cluster of the previous hit.
     * Based on the theory that the next required data set would be available in the current data cluster.
     * Makes hits on the local cluster based on the most recenlty used data.
   * #### Temportal Caching
     * Caching technique based on the frequency of the data usage.
     * Creates a data set at faster levels of cache memory.
     * Based on the theory that the most frequently data set might be required further down the process.
     * Imports a data set, then based on the usage of the data, keeps the most used data in faster levels of the cache memory.
